<h3> The aim of this project is to build a currency detector for Indian Currencies </h3/>
<p> The images were trained on Classifiers like Mobilenet_v2 and Object Detecting Algorithm YOLO_v3.</p>
<p> The directory pretrained models contains the script for running Classifiers for real time detection and other purposes.</p>
<p> The results on YOLO_v3_tiny are shown by the demo videos</p>
